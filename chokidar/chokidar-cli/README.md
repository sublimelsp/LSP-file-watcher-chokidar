# Chokidar CLI

Fast cross-platform command line utility to watch file system changes based on https://github.com/open-cli-tools/chokidar-cli, rewritten to be controlled through `stdin` rather than a command line arguments and with some changes to cater for its intended use in a LSP file watcher.

The underlying watch library is [Chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar).
